# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This Terraform module provisions:

    * An S3 bucket for session logs in Gravitational [Teleport](https://gravitational.com/teleport)
    * 2 DynamoDB tables to use as storage backend in Teleport

  ## Features

  Using DynamoDB as a storage backend allows highly available deployments of Teleport Auth services.

  Using S3 for Teleport session storage has many advantages:

  * Encryption at rest
  * Versioned objects
  * Lifecycle Support to expunge old sessions (e.g. after 2 years)
  * Extreme Availability & Durability
  * Zero Maintenance
  * Glacier
  * Cross Region Replication
  * S3 Bucket could be owned by tamper-proof AWS Audit Account
  * Easily prevent deletions
  * Audit Trails, Access Logs via Cloud Trails

usage: |-

  ```hcl
  module "teleport_storage" {
    source = "cloudposse/teleport-storage/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"

    standard_transition_days = var.s3_standard_transition_days
    glacier_transition_days  = var.s3_glacier_transition_days
    expiration_days          = var.s3_expiration_days
  }
  ```
