# terraform-aws-teleport-storage [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-teleport-storage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-teleport-storage)

## Introduction

This Terraform module provisions:

* An S3 bucket for session logs in Gravitational [Teleport](https://gravitational.com/teleport)
* An IAM policy with permissions to create and access a DynamoDB table to use as storage backend in Teleport

__NOTE:__ Teleport creates a DynamoDB table with the specified name automatically

https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/


## Features

Using DynamoDB as a storage backend allows highly available deployments of Teleport Auth services.

Using S3 for Teleport session storage has many advantages:

* Encryption at rest
* Versioned objects
* Lifecycle Support to expunge old sessions (e.g. after 2 years)
* Extreme Availability & Durability
* Zero Maintenance
* Glacier
* Cross Region Replication
* S3 Bucket could be owned by tamper-proof AWS Audit Account
* Easily prevent deletions
* Audit Trails, Access Logs via Cloud Trails
